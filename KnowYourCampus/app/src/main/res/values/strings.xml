    <string name="rules_text">In this game, players are presented with a randomized set of descriptive questions about
        the buildings on CSUN\'s campus. The goal is to answer all the questions correctly as fast as possible.\n\n
        After pressing the <i>Play</i> button, players will be presented with a map of CSUN and a question below it.
        They must scroll the map until they find the building they think answers the question best. Players must then
        \"long press\" the building on the map.\n\n
        If their answer is correct, a green border will surround their building of choice. If their answer is incorrect,
        the correct building will be displayed, with a red border surrounding it. After submitting their answer, an
        informative piece of trivia regarding CSUN will appear where the question previously was.\n\n
        Correct answers will also be awarded with an increment to the game\'s score. This increment is determined by
        two factors: the difficulty of the question (easy, medium or hard), as well as the milliseconds the player had
        remaining prior to answering it.\n\n
        When the player is ready to continue, they then press the \"Next Question\" button at the top of the screen.
        This cycle then repeats itself for all of the game questions until the last one is answered, and at this point
        it\'s <i>Game Over</i>.\n\n
        At the end of the game, the player\'s score can be sent to a leaderboard, where they can see how they rank up
        against other players. Given the variability of the score, this will incentivize the player to continue playing
        in order to get the highest score, and in the process, increasing their knowledge of CSUN\'s history and
        locations.\n\n
        In order to avoid cheating however, games are reset whenever the application is paused or exited for any
        reason.\n\n
